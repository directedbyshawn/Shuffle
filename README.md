# Shuffle

### Description
Shuffle is a Spotify Web Interface that allows you to view your playlists, and all of the songs in them. It collects data using the Spotify Web API. Currently the only functionality is to view your library, but I plan to add the ability to add to it as well soon. I also plan to add more analytical features to the app to let users see data about their music tastes. Spotify provides lots of intersting data points for songs and playlists so I have plenty to experiment with. 

### Setup
Currently this project is not setup for other users to easily test, but it will be in the future. If you wish to mess with the code yourself, the dependencies are in `requirements.txt` so install from there. If you have experience with the Spotify Web API, you can link your account by creating a `creds.txt` file in the app directory. On the first line, place your client id. On the second line, your client secret. Doing this will allow you to launch the app yourself and view your account data.
